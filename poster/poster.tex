        Why, hello there!  \LaTeX{} is a tool for professional
        typesetting.  It is used by academics, researchers, and
        professionals \emph{all over the world}.  It is written in
        plain text in the \LaTeX{} format.  Like HTML, \LaTeX{} is a
        \textsl{markup language}; while Turing complete for all my
        geeks out there, it is designed to be simple to understand
        even in its plain-text form.

        Writing \LaTeX{} is easy: all you need is an editor (any text
        editor will do) and what we call a \TeX{} distribution.  A
        \TeX{} distribution is just a fancy way of saying `everything
        you need to produce a document with \LaTeX{}.  This usually
        includes the main programs (\texttt{tex}, \texttt{latex},
        \texttt{pdftex}, \texttt{pdflatex}, etc.) and a slew of other
        helpful, supplementary programs (\texttt{texdoc},
        \texttt{texhash}, etc.).  This may seem like a lot, but the
        only program you will ever have any dealings with on a regular
        basis is in fact \texttt{pdflatex},\footnote{\texttt{tex} and
          \texttt{latex} turn these source files into what is called a
          DVI, an even more portable format.} the program that will
        take a properly-formatted \LaTeX{} source file and turn it
        into a PDF.
