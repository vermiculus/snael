        %What has currently been done, what is it good for, what are
        %you trying to do, start with the general, going into
        %specifics

        Computer science is more than just programming software for
        industry; a great portion of `research in computer science' is
        actually that of algorithms, of complexity theory, and of
        human-computer interaction.

        What is \ac{nlp}?  \Ac{nlp} is an incredibly broad topic with
        tens of subfields, but here are some highlights for the
        current research:

        \begin{description}[\Ac{ner}\acreset{ner}]
        \item[Part-of-Speech Tagging] tries to recognize the
          syntactical positions of words in a sentence
        \item[\Ac{ner}] identifies nouns in a text and categorizes
          them into groups (e.g.~location, organization, person, \dots)
        \item[Coreference resolution] deals with aliases of entities
          (both proper and common) in a text
        \end{description}

        Why study \ac{nlp}?  \Ac{nlp} is a significant part of
        human-computer interaction.

          hear,\footnote{speech recognition}
