Sean saw Padraig.  Padraig gave Sean a project.  Sean accepted
Padraig's project.  Sean workked on the project.  Padraig asked Sean
about the project.  This is a silly sentence.  Sean told Padraig, "I
really don't know what I'm doing."  Padraig told Sean, "Don't worry,
this is some weird shit."
